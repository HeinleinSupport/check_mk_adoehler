Plugin for SEP Sesam version 4.0 and higher
(see www.sep.de)

This plugin is designed to integrate with Nagios or compatible monitoring products.

The various options, along with examples for Nagios, are documented in the plugin itself.

Please note that the plugin requires that the SEP Sesam environment is set up - /var/opt/sesam/var/ini/sesam2000.profile

You will need to run this plugin on the Backup Server itself as it requires local access to the database
